*Assignment6.ipynb:* is the Google Colaboratory notebook for Assignment no. 6.

*Datasets.zip:* is a zipped folder with all the .csv files with AUC and Average Precision of all discretized data by using 3 different algorithms (k-means, quantile, uniform) and 3 different parameters for each.

*Unsupervised_Anomaly_Detection.zip:* is a zipped folder with 95 folders. Each folder contains one database (file .dat) for train and one for test.

*dfAUC:* AUC metric got in Assignment 5 (not useful for Assignment 6)

*discret_uns_kmeans7.csv:* Evaluation for unsupervised DTAE algorithm. Metric: AUC and Average Precision of discretized data by using K-Means algorithm with 7 bins.
